README:

Line 2 + 3 looks like this:
src_folder = '/Users/pan/osskoletest/'
dst_folder = '/Users/pan/osskoledestination/'

To change where the source folder and the destination folder is, change these parameters: Everything within the '.....' is changeable, so you could replace source with '/Your/source/folder/' and destination folder with '/Your/destination/folder/'
